librtfcomp changelog
====================


1/3/2007 Dr J A Gow
-------------------

Version 1.0 released. Discard and destroy any versions you have that are older
than this, as they have an incomplete and incompatible API, and they do not
have the Python bindings. Furthermore, versions lower than 1.0 are bug-ridden
and just don't work.

V1.0 contains: First API release. Can decompress/recompress compressed RTF, 
and can convert from UTF8 to RTF for use in things like AirSync protocols.

4/3/2007 Dr J A Gow
-------------------

Applied patch by Robert Jarzmik to fix:

 - memory overflow when notes are bigger than 512 bytes
 - UTF8 to RTF conversion mishandling

14/3/2007 Dr J A Gow
--------------------

Applied patch by Robert Jarzmik to:

 - significantly improve RTF handling for Unicode characters
 - isolation of control words for futur support (color, font, bullets)
 - identification of group level (braces)
 - handling for unicode characters in RTF flow 
   (euro symbol, accents, exotic caracters => rtf control \uNc)
