Some hints for the rra- tools follow.

Generic:

o Use synce-matchmaker to create a partnership
o Use rra-get-types to list the names of the data types on the device

Retrieving from device:

o Use rra-get-ids to get the ids and their status (unchanged, changed, deleted)
o Use rra-get-data to get data from the device
o Use rra-decode to dump the data from the device
o Use rra-*-to-* to convert PIM data to text formats

Sending to device:

o Use rra-*-from-* to convert PIM text formats to device data
o Use rra-put-data to send data to the device
