Information about the librra architecture
=========================================

Conversion between vCard/vCalendar and Windows CE database records is performed
by appointment.c, contact.c and task.c.

The code in appointment.c and task.c uses libmimedir to parse vCalendar data,
contact.c has its own parsing of vCards (because they have a slightly different
format...)

The parser.[hc] files contain helper functions to interpret vCalendar data
after it has been parsed by libmimedir, and generator.[hc] contain helper
functions to generate vCalendar data.

The dbstream.[hc] files contain helper functions to convert a database record
between stream format and an array of CEPROPVAL structures.

The timezone.[hc] files contain helper functions to get the timezone settings
from the PDA and handle timezone data in vCalendar files.
