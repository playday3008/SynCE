o-vdccm
-------

This is a daemon process that sits between odccm and any
non-odccm aware application that require information about
connected synCE devices. Note that this is not required for
rapi calls, only apps that talk directly to the dccm.

In particular this will allow raki, in the synce-kde package,
to respond to odccm events.

This daemon should be installed in place of vdccm if you
plan to use odccm with synce-kde. It looks sufficiently
similar to vdccm to replace it.

The only item of note that is missing compared to regular
vdccm is the ability to disconnect a device from raki. This
is because the underlying odccm does not support this function.
Disconnect from your device instead.
