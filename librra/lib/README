INTRODUCTION
============

This file contains some information that hopefully is useful for wannabe librra
hackers.


CODING CONVENTIONS
==================

Tab characters are never used. Two spaces are used for indentation.

Curly braces are always on their own lines.

Function names are lowercase with words separated by underscore.

Variable names are lowercase with words separated by underscore.

Structure names use camel case: first letter in each word uppercase, remaining
letters lowercase. No underscores execpt between prefix (for example "RRA") and
the wanted structure name (for example "SyncMgr").

(Note that the above is not followed perfectly, but should be.)


ABOUT MODULES IN THE RRA LIBRARY
================================

For an RRA module 'foo', there should be a file foo.c and foo.h. All functions
in the foo module should be lowercase only and have the prefix 'rra_foo_'. All
structures should have the prefix 'RRA_Foo' and use camel case after that.

If 'Foo' is an object, there is a structure named RRA_Foo. but the contents of
the structure should be internal to the module. The Foo object is created with
'rra_foo_new' and destroyed with 'rra_foo_destroy'.

(Note that the above is not followed perfectly, but should be.)


ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW
=====================

Synchronization is performed via functions in the syncmgr.c that uses the
rrac.c module for low-level calls.

Conversion between vCard/vCalendar and Windows CE database records is performed
by the appointment.c, contact.c and task.c modules.

The code in appointment.c and task.c uses libmimedir to parse vCalendar data,
contact.c has its own parsing of vCards (because they have a slightly different
format...)

The parser.c module contain helper functions to interpret vCalendar data
after it has been parsed by libmimedir, and generator.c contain helper
functions to generate vCalendar data.

The dbstream.c module contain helper functions to convert a database record
between stream format and an array of CEPROPVAL structures.

The timezone.c module contain helper functions to get the timezone settings
from the PDA and handle timezone data in vCalendar files.

See the rra/src directory for example programs that uses these modules.


HOW TO ADD A PROPERTY CONVERSION FOR CONTACTS, APPOINTMENTS AND TASKS
=====================================================================

The exact code to be added is best deduced by studying the code for the
previously supported properties, but the locations you need to modify are
listed here.


FIND OUT THE PROPERTY ID

1. Use rra-get-data to retrieve an object with this property set

2. Use rra-decode to dump the retrieved object

3. Add the property ID to appointment_ids.h, contact_ids.h or task_ids.h (the
constants in these files are sorted by ID value)


FOR CONTACT OBJECTS

Note that the "Parser" structure in contact.c is internal to this file and is
not the same as the one in parser.[ch]. Sorry!

1. Go to the switch() in the rra_contact_to_vcard2() function in contact.c and
add code for handling the new property

2. Go to the end of the function parser_handle_field() in contact.c and add
code for handling the new property


FOR APPOINTMENT AND TASK OBJECTS

If you wish to add conversion between a vCalendar (vEvent/vTodo) property and
an Appointment/Task property on the PDA, you do something like this:

1. Find the calls to generator_add_property() in appointment.c or task.c, and
add a new such call for the new property

2. Implement the on_propval_* function for the property

3. Find the calls to parser_component_add_parser_property() in appointment.c or
task.c, and add a new such call for the new property

4. Implement the on_mdir_line_* function for the property. If this function is
called with the 'line' parameter set to NULL, the property is _not_ present in
the vCalendar data and a default value may be provided.

If the property exists for both appointments and tasks it might be added to
common_handlers.[ch] and used by both object types.
