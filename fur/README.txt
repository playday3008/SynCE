FUR: a Fuse filesystem Using the Rapi calls.

Documentation (bad, uncomplete and possibly outdated) is in the docs directory
(actually a mirror of the documentation on my personal page:

http://www.infis.univ.trieste.it/~riccardo)

For the impatients: 

a) get FUSE to work
b) get a connection between your linux box and your pocket PC to work (pls
should work before attempting anything else)
c) ./configure (with some extra if the libraries are not found)
d) make
e) make run
f) look at the content of furtest. 
g) play with the files in furtest
h) fusermount -u furtest

Enjoy
