Changelog

0.4.5 
  - Added a patch entirely provided by Alexander Logvinov that forces FUR into
  single threaded mode.
  - multithread support for FUR completely discarded: removed all
  locks and references to the pthread library

0.4.4 Patch kindly contributed by Matthias Gruenewald
  - added a fuse hook to a void chmod call to allow konqueror and 
  FUR to smoothly work together without annoying pop-ups (should 
  be explicitly enabled in configure)	
  - workaround to fix some issues in the librapi when listing the
  "windows" directory on the device that disconnect the PDA on error


0.4.3 
  - Added the time property to the files. All the code for this
  release has been kindly contributed by Matthias Gruenewald.


0.4.2
  - Only documentation changes. Since now the Synce provides everything 
    that FUR needs, FUR will be able to run from here until eternity
    withoug changes.

0.4.1
  - Fixed a bug that prevented FUR to rename a file to an existing destination
  - Fixed a (bug? feature?)... something... which made FUR crash when listing directory with only case different names. 

0.4.0
  - Added a proc filesystem with a power_status file and a regkeys directory.
  - various fix here and there.
  
0.3.0
  - CeSetFilePointer and CeSetEndOfFile added: removed all kludges that
  emulated them: fur now compile on itself (and deserves beta status :-) )
  - Removed almost all the cache: leaved only a (experimental) caching 
  of the offset to speed sequential read/write.

0.2.3
  - Changed locks again in a dummy safe thread mode. Now Fur *IS*
  thread safe... well if we don't consider the cache :-/
  - found bug in seek?

0.2.2
  
  - Cleaned the code from experimental features not needed that
  caused problems (uid/gid checks, fake directory for non dccm
  curious). Not a great loss since fuse is usually run per user.
  - Added a reference counter to the cache (which was what screwed
  all file operations so much...)
  - Rearranged locks in a more conservative way (first make it 
  compile, second make it works, then optimize it...)
  - Introduced Reset and SeekFoward/Backward which _should_ work.


0.2.1 

  - fixed wrong path conversion for names that 
  are not directly convertibiles in ASCII.
  - corrected the configuration script.
  
0.2.0 
  
  - Starting release
