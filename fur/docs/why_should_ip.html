<h1 align="center">Why should i?</h1>

<body>

<p>For instance to tell me that you use <b>FUR</b> and you like it (or you
don't): i can't promise anything, but the more will i feel that this
project is useful to someone and the more i will feel like to fix bugs
or add features and documentation (especially documentation. I
<i>hate</i> writing documentation).</p>

<p>Flames go to <i>/dev/null</i>.</p>

<p>Another good reason is to inform me about a bug, but before you
send me a report, first check that:</p>

<list>

<li>Both <b>Fuse</b> and <b>Synce</b> are set up properly.</li>

<li>You have the last versions of fuse and synce (and you are not
using svn for librapi).</li>

<li>You have read at least <a href="how_do_i_make_it_workp.html">this
page</a>.</li>

<!--<li>Your problem is not yet listed in <a href="BUGS.txt">the bug
list</a>.</li> -->
</list>

<p>After telling me about a bug, be prepared to execute some simple
tasks (like giving me a core dump or a log file of some sort) or
understand my terrible English and wait until i figure out what the
problem is (which can be long if i cannot replicate it on my 
hardware).</p>
