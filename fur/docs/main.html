Long time no see... :-) Checked the mail and found a nice patch,
kindly provided by Alexander Logvinov with the code required to
automatically disable multi-threaded operations with libfuse (which
had to be manually done on the 0.4.4 version, with the recent versions
of synce).</p>

<p>Alexander also reported that FUR is FreeBSD compatible. Seems like
i created a FreeBSD compatible code without ever having installed
one. Geez... I'm good! <b>xD</b></p>

<p>Starting from the release 0.4.5 the -s flag will not be necessary
anymore! Thank you Alexander!</p>

<h3 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">7/12/2008</h3>
<p>
The problem of the compatibility between FUR and the new version of
the librapi (0.12) seem to root in the multi thread access that FUR
does, through fuse, to the synce functions.</p>
<p> The new version of librapi <i>seems</i> to be less tolerant than
the older one for multi thread access: a quick fix to this problem is
to run Fur with the -s option, disabling the thread enabled main loop
in fuse in favour of a serial one.</p>
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">28/11/2008</h3>
<p>
I have verified that the current version of FUR (as well as the 0.4.3) doesn't seem to be compatible with the newer version of librapi (0.12), at least on the HTC Excalibur. I will investigate the issue.
</p>
<p>
People interested in using FUR and with an older and working version of the synce libraries are encouraged to stick to it, at least until the issue will be sorted. Thank you for your patience.

New minor version of FUR released: 0.4.4, made entirely from the code
submitted by <b>Matthias Gruenewald</b>. No new features this time,
but some problem has been taken care of. See the changelog for more.</p>
<p>This release also (un)implement some changes that i slipped without
notice in the 0.4.3 release: namely the truncate call, which caused a
lot of problems with the new librapi releases which doesn't implement
it, has been removed.
</p>
<h3 style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">10/10/2007</h3> I am now a (not so)
proud owner of a HTC S620 which works with synce just fine: this means
that i will be able again to work on <span style="font-weight:
bold;">FUR</span>, if i will have time (not right now, since im in the
middle of the solo campaign of "Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory" :-) what
a busy life...).
</p>
<p>I have run the last version (<span style="font-weight:
bold;">0.4.3</span>, patch entirely contributed by <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Matthias Gruenewald</span>) from the first
time and it worked fine (with the notable exception of the proc tree
which never worked properly, since it's implementation, on WM5-WM6
devices) however during the compilation i have noticed that the
function <span style="font-weight: bold;">CESetEndOfFile</span> has
been disabled in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">SVN</span>: this
means that if you want to compile <span style="font-weight:
bold;">FUR</span>, you'll have to use the freshmeat synce packages
(0.10.0) or (if you want to compile the <span style="font-weight:
bold;">Synce</span> packages) the source packages (not the SVN).</p>
<p>
Hard core programmers may of course simply use the svn source and
remove the appropriate '#if 0/#endif' lines from the librapi2 package
in order to re-enable the API again. At their own risk, of course :-)

<span style="font-weight: bold;">FUR</span> is apparently working with
Synce 0.10.0 without the need of patches of special compilations of
sorts: this also means <span style="font-weight: bold;">WM5</span>
support.<br>
<br>
The new version of the Synce is out (thanks to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Genix</span> for waking me up...) and all
the calls that <span style="font-weight: bold;">FUR </span>needs in
order to work are now included (along with a lot of other calls <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">FUR </span>might make good use of, if only
i would work on it...): a big thank you to the people of the Synce
Project. <br>
<br>
This means that you can use the 0.10.0 version of the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Synce</span> project in order to run <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">FUR</span> without patching, recompiling or
anything, or at least this is what people told to me (thanks to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">LunohoD</span>)...<br>
<br>
Not all news are good: one of the reason why&nbsp; <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">FUR</span> was almost abandonware&nbsp;
last year is that since i have a new pocket PC (an HP rx1950) i have
not been able to use the Synce tools (though i didn't tried very hard
and it could be all my fault, im not complaining). This means that im
not able to run my own software (<span style="font-weight: bold;">FUR</span>
relies on a working <span style="font-weight: bold;">Synce</span>
connection), which is very bad for me and that i cannot work on <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">FUR</span> as well (which is bad for
you...).<br>
<br>
However i will try to carry on the developing using the HP2100 of my
father or my old and almost broken HP1910 tough im very overworked and
not being able to make any use of <span style="font-weight: bold;">FUR</span>
for myself is quite a put off... Don't expect new features in the short
term... :-p.<br>
<br>
If someone has any news about connecting an rx1950 with synce in any
way (is wireless connection feasible? AFAIK only USB is supported),
this would be of great help.<br>

<p>Thank to <b>northx</b> im working on <b>FUR</b> again and i've
noticed how unclear my site is (If 90% of people that read my site
cannot find the informations they need to compile and install
<i>maybe</i> it's my fault <b>:-)</b> ).</p>
<p>Therefore im reorganizing my site, removing the obsolete
informations and adding the latest news in the proper sections: i
don't like to write documentation very much, but i have vowed not to
let the "Latest News" section grow too much without integrating the
infos in the site.</p>
<p>The old <b>FUR</b> page will be available <a
 href="FUR_old_page.html">here</a> as everlasting testament of my
laziness.</p>
<p>I browsed the <a href="http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/">Synce
Project page</a> and it seems the developers did a <b>lot</b> of work
since the last time i checked (Thank you!), some of which will
directly benefit <b>FUR</b> once i will have done the homework; the
same can be said about <b><a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">
Fuse</a></b>: <b>FUR</b> uses it through the <i>API version 22</i>
though the current is <i>26</i>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>At the moment I'm not much interested in FUR anymore: mostly
because i don't connect winCE based devices to my computer anymore
(and when i do, to just move data, i find FUR overkill and slow when
compared with a SSD card reader), however i keep mantaining the
project by applying third party patches and trying to fix bugs when
they are reported, if I'm able to.</p>

<p>Please be patient if i don't answer to your email immediately: as
far as i know, everyone that contacted me about FUR always got an
answer eventually (mean wait time ranges from 1 day to a week,
depending on various factors, including spam...). Thank you all for
your patience and contributions.</p>
