<h1 align="center">How do i make it work?</h1>
<p>I will not go inside the details of the installation and
configuration of <b>FUSE</b> and the <b>Synce libraries and tools</b>
on your machine (you can find all the instructions you may need <a
 href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/">here</a> and <a
 href="http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/howto.php">here</a>), just
 remember that you will need the last pre-packaged version of the
 <b>Synce</b> distribution in order to install everything without
 problems.</p>


<p>Please keep in mind that you should be able to connect your device
with the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Synce</span> software and to
mount a filesystem with <span style="font-weight: bold;">FUSE</span>
before being able to use <span style="font-weight: bold;">FUR</span>.</p>
<p>After you know for sure that both the programs that <b>FUR</b>
relies on are working correctly on your system (you can do a
<b>pls</b> and <b>pcp</b> on your Pocket PC and you correctly mounted
a <b>Fuse filesystem</b>) you can download <b>FUR</b> from <a
 href="downloads">here</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><b>FUR</b> has a configuration tool, yet far from perfect, which
should work with a bit of tweaking with the <b>CFLAGS</b>,
<b>CPPFLAGS</b> and <b>LDFLAGS</b> environment variables (or having a
comprehensive <b>PKG_CONFIG_PATH</b> variable set).<br>
</p>
<p>On my system i install synce in the /usr/local/synce directory and
therefore i do those steps before configuring:<br>
</p>
<pre>export CPPFLAGS=-I/usr/local/synce/include<br>export LDFLAGS=-L/usr/local/synce/lib</pre>
<p>This is of course just an example... :-)<br>
</p>
<p>After the ./configure step, simply enter the <tt>src</tt> directory
and issue:</p>
<tt>./make</tt>
<p>and if everything goes well a small binary named Fur will
appear. <br>
</p>
<p>Do you want to try it, don't you? Run:</p>
<tt>./Fur destination_directory</tt> (add a "-s" option for Fur
versions prior 0.4.5)
<p>and the content of your pocket PC should appear in that directory.</p>
<p>When you want to unmount it simply issue:</p>
<tt>fusermount -u destination_directory</tt>
<p>If something goes wrong and you can't unmount the file system, in
order:</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>DON'T PANIC</b></li>
  <li>If <tt>fusermount -u</tt> says that the device is busy, use ps
to
check that there's no process running inside the <b>FUSE</b> file
system.</li>
  <li>If everything fails, try <tt>killall -9 Fur</tt> and then again
retry step 2.</li>
</ol>
