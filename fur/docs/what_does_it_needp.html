<h1 align="center">What does it need?</h1>
<h2 align="center">Short answer</h2>
<list>
<li> a <b>GNU</b>/<b>Linux</b> system or <b>FreeBSD</b>.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/"><b>Fuse</b></a>
incarnation which provides at least the <i>22</i>
  <i>API</i> version (the current one will do), with headers.</li>
<li>the packages of the <b>Synce</b> project (the latest version should be ok, don't use the
<b>SVN</b> version since <b>CESetEndOfFile</b> seem disabled) and
  <b>librapi</b>, both with headers.</li>
</list>
<h2 align="center">Long answer</h2>

<p><b>FUR</b> is entirely based on two other softwares: <a
 href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/"><b>FUSE</b></a> and the libraries
of the <a href="http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/">Synce Project</a>
which means you need both in order to make it work.</p>

<p>The current version (<i>0.4.5</i>) should work with the latest version of
<b>Synce</b>: i don't check the new versions of Synce periodically I'm
acraid, and therefore feel free to mail me if something in the last
one is not compatible with FUR (in case you didn't noticed already,
I'm really, really lazy :-) ).</p>

<p>You also need <b>Fuse</b>, the version of which does not matter
very much, since <b>FUR</b> uses a quite old version of the
<b>APIs</b>.</p>

<p><b>FUR</b> is developed on Linux systems, although it should work
on FreeBSD (and possibly other BSD flavours): keep in mind however
that i don't have the opportunity to test it personally and therefore
i could not be able to iron OS related bugs...)</p>

<p>As a rule of thumb, before even thinking about using <b>FUR</b> you
should be able to:</p>
<list>
<li>Mount a <b>Fuse</b> based filesystem on your machine (one of the
examples that comes with the package should do, but be sure to check
the <b>Fuse</b> site for links to more interesting ones, like
  <b>sshfs</b>)</li>
<li>Connect your Pocket PC with the tools of the <b>Synce Project</b>
and be able at the very least to do a <i>pls</i> and a <i>pcp</i> on
it (just to be sure that everything works fine).</li>
</list>
<p>After this, if you are able to compile FUR on your OS, odds are
that it will work too.</p>
