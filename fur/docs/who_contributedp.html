<h1 align="center">WHO CONTRIBUTED TO FUR?</h1>
</head>
<body>

<p>As time passes, and increasingly large number of people contributed
to the development in a way that i cannot honestly say that FUR is my
creature only anymore.</p>

<p>Here is a list of people who contributed to the project in a major
way, in a (sort of) chronological order: to all the ones that aren't
mentioned but still provided feedback or bug reports: thank you!</p>

<ul><li>
The <b>FUSE</b> and <b>Synce Project</b> creators, developers and
mantainers. Simply: no <b>FUSE</b>/<b>Synce</b> =&gt; no <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">FUR</span>. If you want to contribute to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">FUR</span> you can try to contribute to
those 2 projects in a way or another.&nbsp;

</li><li>
<p><b>Alexander Logvinov</b> who contributed all relevant code for
version 0.4.5 (which removes the need to specify the -s flag on the
command line to insure single threaded operations) and also tested
<b>FUR</b> on <b>FreeBSD</b> with positive results, as well as the new
0.4.5 release.</p> 

<p>Thank you for all your work and for your patience!</p>

</li><li>
<p><b>Matthias Gruenewald</b> who contributed all the new code which
made the 0.4.3 release of <b>FUR</b> possible, adding the time
information to the files.</p> 

<p>Matthias also implemented all changes in the 0.4.4 release: a quick fix to work around some instability issues of the librapi when reading the windows directory on some devices, as well as a void chmod hook (that can be enabled with the <tt>--enable-void-chmod</tt> option in the <tt>configure</tt> that prevents some unnerving popups when working with konqueror.</p>

<p>Thank you for the patches, and my apologies for the delay between
your submission and the new minor releases!

<p><b>Genix</b>, the first person that contacted me about <b>FUR</b>
for
his feedback on the software and help in both bug fixing and configure
scripts (he also made a <i>SRPM</i> package for
<b>FUR</b> for the <b>ALT</b>-linux distribution: the page is in
russian, bug links are in English).
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b>Lazlo</b> who helped me with a useful bug report that crashed
<b>FUR</b> when 2 files, different only in case where in the same
directory (i still wonder how this is possible in a case indifferent
environment like Windows CE...).
</p>
</li><li>
<p><b>Clemens R.</b> who reported me a bug that prevented a file to
be moved over another.<br>
</p>
</li><li>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">LunohoD</span> who probably tried
quite hard to install <span style="font-weight: bold;">FUR </span>with
synce 0.10.0 after i told him that it wasn't possible and proved me
wrong... :-)<br>
</p>
<p>
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Last but not least, <b>All</b> the people that counted an hit on
the
<b>FUR</b> page on freshmeat (mostly me, im afraid... <b>:-)</b>),
especially those who subscribed (not me), thus giving me the feeling 
that what i was doing mattered.
</p>
