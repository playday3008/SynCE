<h1 align="center">What does not? (with alternatives to FUR)</h1>

<ul>
<li><p>Files attributes are not really supported: permissions are all assumed
rwx for everything: if you try to write or read on the (mostly system)
files which doesn't allow that, you end up with a (non descriptive)
error.<br>
</p></li>

<li><p>More of the same about <i>strange</i> files attributes like
"compressed", "system" and "ram" that i found on the <b>RAPI</b>
specification and about what i have no clue: i simply assume
that they don't exist at all.&nbsp; Just be a nice girl/guy, and don't
go messing in the /windows directory, ok?! ;-)</p></li>

<li><p>The proc-like filesystem doesn't work on the newer
devices</p></li>

<li>Some bugs might still be present, specifically there seems to be
some issue with devices using special locale settings (i have an
unresolved report of a user which had strange crashes with a WM5 which
seemed to work perfectly with Synce...).</p></li>

</ul>

<p>At the moment i have only a HTC Dash (where FUR works fine) to test
the code with: i don't have a broad picture of what happens with other
devices.</p>

<p> A final note about performances: i didn't tried to speed up
<b>FUR</b> very much, however being a filesystem on top of userlevel
libraries implies that <b>FUR</b> will <b>always</b> be slower than
high level utilities like <a
href="http://www.synce.org/index.php/KDE">raki</a>, <a
href="http://www.synce.org/index.php/Gnome">synce</a> or the command
line tools (<b>pcp</b>,<b>pls</b> and so on)

<p>For the way it's constructed, FUR will do dozens of RAPI calls
(which are the real bottleneck for the PC/PPC operations) each time
you list a directory or transfer even a medium sized file (transfers
are done in chunks) where the aforementioned utilities need only 1
RAPI call for each transfer. This gap is particularly evident with the
old Pocket PC 2003 devices (newer ones work remarkably well).</p>

<p>If you don't care about the whole <i>"i have my device on the file
system"</i> thing and you simply need a way to copy and access files
on/from the Pocket PC with Linux as fast and effortless as possible,
you should definitely use the aforementioned utilities (which are
probably more stable than <b>FUR</b> as well, since better supported
by the Synce team).</p>

<p>I'd like also to mention <a
href="http://www.lvivier.info/SynceFS/"> SynceFS</a>, a file system
created by <a href="http://www.lvivier.info/"> Laurent Vivier</a> by
modifying <a href="http://www.coda.cs.cmu.edu/">coda</a>: it's a
kernel module, and therefore a different approach than FUR, but you
might well be interested in trying it.<br>
