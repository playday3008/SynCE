<p>Please, see the <a href="file:../COPYING.txt">licence</a> first
(which will tell also that you that i don't take any responsability
whatsoever for what you do with my code).</p>

<p>A lot of things: you can copy, rename, seek (but not truncate) files
and, at least on my 2003 device, the proc-like file system that shows
power status and registry keys seems to works (seems like that on
WM5/6 it doesn't work)</p>

<p>
This means that you should be able to do most of the things you do on
your file system on a Pocket PC device, once everything is set up (for
what you <b>can't</b> do, refer to the next page).
