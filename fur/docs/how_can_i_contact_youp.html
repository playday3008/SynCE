<h1 align="center">How can i contact you?</h1>

<p>You can send me a mail (riccardo A_t_ infis Dot univ D0t trieste
d0t it): please use a meaningful title, like <b>"FUR: something"</b>
or <b>"fur: something else"</b></p>
<p>Since a lot of concerned strangers seem to think lately that my
sexual life would improve with V1ag3az or a bigger penis, the <b>"fur:
.."</b> convention will help me discern people requesting my help from
the ones who actually would like to help me.</p>

<p>I still have a <b>#fur</b> channel on <b>Freenode</b>, however i
must admit that i don't use it at all lately. If you are already there
you might try to drop in, but don't log there just for me. You would
be disappointed.</p>

<p>Up to now i think i did answer to any mail i received (not an issue
since the pressure i've received from this project has been very low),
but i cannot guarantee for an immediate one. The average delay is
about 1 week but it might vary depending on my status. If you mailed
me: please be patient, i'll be back to you.</p>
