<h1 align="center">What it does?</h1>
<p>It allows you to read and write data on your Pocket PC as if it
where on a local directory: you can create, remove, rename, read and
write files in there as if they where local (this is at least true for
files which doesn't have <i>"special" attributes</i>, like the files
in the window directory).</p>

<p>A recently added (and <i>experimental</i>) feature is a proc like
directory that contains information about the power status of the
pocket PC and let the user browse (read only) it's registry keys as
normal files and directories (this feature seems actually to work
nicely on old <i>WM2003</i> devices, your mileage on&nbsp; <i>WM5</i>
may vary: as long as your device is supported by <span
style="font-weight: bold;">Synce</span>, <span style="font-weight:
bold;">Fur</span> *should* work as well).<br>
</p>

<p>Since everything happens at an operating system level, a nice side
effect of this is that all programs installed on your computer will
see the content of your pocket PC as normal files and directories and
will be therefore able to access them without knowing about their
origin.</p>
<p>This is a small list of things you can do with the files and
directories, once <b>FUR</b> is correctly installed and set up:</p>
<list>
<li>Browse the files on your pocket PC with the same programs you use
to <i>copy</i>/<i>cut</i> and <i>paste</i> the files on your desktop
(like the <i>File Browsers</i> of <b>GNOME</b> or <b>KDE</b> or
  <b>Midnight Commander</b>).</li>
<li>Open and manipulate the media files on your device (images, video,
sounds) with your favorite programs (like <b>Mozilla</b>, <b>XINE</b>,
  <b>XMMS</b> or <b>GIMP</b>).</li>
<li>Use your scripting or programming language of choice to work with
files on the Pocket PC exactly as if they were on your hard disk, e.g.
with the <b>C</b> <i>fopen()</i> function or <b>Python</b>
  <i>file()</i>.</li>
<li>Use the command line on the data of your pocket PC (<i>grep</i>, <i>diff</i>,
  <i>gawk</i>...): <b>bash</b> rules!</li>
