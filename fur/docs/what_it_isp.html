<p><b>FUR</b> is an application that let the user mount a <i>Windows
CE</i> based device on your Linux file system: it uses the brilliant
<a href="http://fuse.sourceforge.net/"><b>FUSE</b></a> and the
<i>librapi2</i> of the <a
href="http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/">Synce Project</a> (a *nix
implementation of the <b>RAPI</b> protocol that your device uses to
communicate with your other operating <b>$</b>ystem) to give you the
illusion that the storage of your Pocket PC is a directory on your
local filesystem (may UNIX be blessed for the "mount" approach).</p>


<p>The latest incarnation of <b>FUR</b> also implements a(n
experimental) feature which lets you browse the registry of your pocket
PC and it's power status in a /proc like directory (at least on the
old <i>Windows CE</i> devices. This is experimental however and I'm
aware of some bugs in it already).</p>

<p>Tecnically speaking, <b>FUR</b> is a <b>Fuse</b> based filesystem
that wraps the librapi2 of the <b>Synce Project</b>.
