This is an implementation of a gvfs backend for SynCE. Gvfs is a
replacement for gnome-vfs, allowing applications to access a
variety of filesystems in userspace, in this case a Windows
Mobile device via SynCE.

Most of the common operations are now implemented.


Building
--------
Gvfs is still new, and there is not yet an easy way of building
3rd party, 'out of tree' backends. A number of source files from
the main gvfs tree are required. There are two ways to build this
package.

1) Have a built source tree of gvfs available, and pass 
   --with-gvfs-source=<path-to-source> to this package's configure
   script.

2) Have a source tree of gvfs available. In the make-dist
   subdirectory, edit make-dist.sh and change @with_gvfs_source@
   to the root of this tree. Run make-dist.sh, which will copy the
   required files and change build files. At this point you can
   build normally or 'make dist', for example.



This software may well crash, all bug reports are welcome.
