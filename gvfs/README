This is a very early implementation of a gvfs backend for SynCE.

Gvfs is still new, and there does not yet appear to be an easy way
of building 3rd party, 'out of tree' backends. To build this
package, you will therefore need a built source tree of gvfs
available, and pass --with-gvfs-source=<path-to-source> to this
packages configure script.


Currently only the following operations are implemented.

mounting
unmounting
file info queries

This software WILL crash, all bug reports are welcome.
