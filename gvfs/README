This is an implementation of a gvfs backend for SynCE. Gvfs is a
replacement for gnome-vfs, allowing applications to access a
variety of filesystems in userspace, in this case a Windows
Mobile device via SynCE.


Building
--------
Gvfs is still new, and there is not yet an easy way of building
3rd party, 'out of tree' backends, due to the lack of a public
interface. Therefore a number of source files from the main gvfs
source tree are required.


1) If you have obtained this software as a package, it most likely
   includes the required files from gvfs, and can be built with
   the standard ./configure; make; make install.

   If your distribution uses a different version of gvfs, you can
   pass --with-gvfs-source=<path-to-source> to this package's
   configure script.

2) If you instead obtained this directly from synce svn, the
   required gvfs source files are only dummy files, you must use
   the --with-gvfs-source option to configure.

   NB. when 'make dist' is used with this configure option, the
   resulting package will contain the source files from the
   source pointed to.

The --with-gvfs-source-version option should be used to tailor the
build system for incompatible changes in gvfs. The default is gvfs
1.2.x

This software may well crash, all bug reports are welcome.
