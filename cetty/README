This tool is opens a serial port, and waits for a connection
from a CE device.

It then starts PPPd with the supplied parameters. It will wait forever
for a new connection once PPPd frees the serial port.

You can (try to) manually force a new connection by sending a TERM, USR1 or
USR2 signal to the application (use the 'wakeup' script for example).

Syntax :

cetty <device> <path_to_pppd> [<pppd_arg1> [<pppd_arg2>] ...]

for example : 

./cetty /dev/ttyS1 /usr/sbin/pppd -detach call ipaq



You can put it in /etc/inittab if you want it to respawn on failure.


All the log is done in syslog.
