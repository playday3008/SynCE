To compile from CVS, do something like this:

$ make -f Makefile.dist
$ ./configure --prefix=/your/prefix/for/kde/programs/
$ make
$ make install


Notes:

o This is work in progress. Do not expect anything to function as
  expected!

o The default prefix in the configure script is /usr/local/kde

o The configure script currently assumes that libchunk, libwine
  and librapi is installed with /usr/local as prefix.

o You may need to add /usr/local/lib (or wherever libwine and
  librapi are located) to your /etc/ld.so.conf and run ldconfig.
  If in doubt, run 'ldd kio_synce.so' cheack the path to libwine,
  libchunk & librapi are correct.
	
o The configure script will probably fail if you have the real
  libwine installed.
