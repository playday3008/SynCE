SynCE-KDE
=========

One effort in integrating SynCE into KDE is the SynCE-KDE project - formerly 
Rapip/Raki. SynCE-KDE essentially consists of the three subprojects RAPIP, RAKI,
and VDCCM. In general, they all support the same devices which are supported by
the underlying SynCE libraries.

RAPIP is the short form for "RAPI-Protocol". It is a full featured KIOSlave 
used to browse through the PDA file system and to copy files to and from the 
PDA by drag and drop via Konqueror.

RAKI is a synonym for "Remote-Access-KIcker-applet". As the name suggests it 
has first been an applet for kicker, the KDE panel but as time goes by the 
application-type changed. Today RAKI  is an application docking into the KDE 
system-tray. It is responsible for all additional tasks which are desired for 
interacting with the PDA via the desktop.

VDCCM is a generalization of the native SynCE-DCCM but is fully compatible with 
it. In addition to all DCCM features it is capable of supporting more than one 
PDA connected at the same time. It is responsible for reporting all connects 
and disconnects of PDAs to interested clients via an unix-socket by use of a 
simple protocol. E.g. RAKI is one of such an interested client.
