Compiling and Installing
Requisites
    * Install the base SynCE libraries as described 
      at http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/using.php#download.
    * Make the SynCE libraries work by getting connected for the first time.
    * If you want the AvantGO synchronizer plugin to be compiled, you also have 
      to download and compile agsync-0.2-pre.tgz from 
      http://www.mechlord.ca/%7Elownewulf/avantgo.html provided by Michael 
      Jarrett. Note, compilation of agsync-0.2-pre is enough - installation is 
      not required but of course allowed ;-)

SynCE-KDE compilation and installation
   1. Download SynCE-KDE (synce-kde-0.6.tar.gz) from the SourceForge Project 
      Page or check out the latest code from the CVS repository.

   2. If you have downloaded from the SourceForge Project Page go ahead to 
      step 4.

   3. After checking out SynCE-KDE from CVS do a
          # make -f Makefile.cvs
      and go to step 5.

   4. Unpack the downloaded synce-kde-0.6.tar.gz into your favorite source 
      directory
          # tar -xzf synce-kde-0.6.tar.gz

   5. Configure your SynCE-KDE source tree by issuing the command
          # ./configure
      If you want the AvantGo synchronization plugin also to be compiled, issue
          # ./configure --with-agsync=/path/to/agsync/source/dir/

   6. After configuring SynCE-KDE compile and install it by simply doing a
          # make
      and as root
          # make install

First start:
   - Launch Raki from the "KMenu->Utilities"-Menu. You should find a new 
     black&white icon in your System-Tray.
   - Right-klick on the icon lets you choose some actions to manipulate dccm and
     to configure the Raki-Applet.
   - Make sure dccm is running eighter via Raki or by starting it on the 
     console.
   - Initiate a connection by running "synce-serial-start".
   - The icon in your System Tray should now be colored.
   - By left-klick on the icon you can now interact with your PDA.
