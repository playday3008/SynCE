This is a set of tests for validating the RAPI api.
This set is copyrighted 2001, David Eriksson

o The tests are named after the primary function that is tested

o A special header file, test.h, contains some helper functions and ugly
  macros

o The tests leak memory, but who cares, they are tests!

o The main() function in each test return 0 on success and 1 on failure

o In the CeOpenDatabase test, I have documented quite many database
  property IDs

o There is also a program called pcp (PocketCoPy) that copies a file from
  the PC to the "My Documents" directory on the handheld. Very handy.

o It is possible to write "make test" in the tests directory to run most
  of the tests sequentially.

o I have not copyright or licence notes for the tests, but they are of
  course copyright me and as they link to librapi, they are GPL...

See the file README in the main directory.
