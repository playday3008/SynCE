This tool dumps all (or part of) the databases that are stored in your device.

The device holds a few databases (contacts, appointments, mails, etc...).
This dumps the databases as an xml-structured file.


See the file README in the main directory.

TODO :
 - play with XSLT in order to :
	1) extract specific databases from the backup,
	2) rename some fields that have a signification, for example, in contacts :
		<LPWSTR propid="0x4002"> -> assistant
		<LPWSTR propid="0x4004"> -> assistant phone
		<LPWSTR propid="0x3A06"> -> first name
		<LPWSTR propid="0x3A11"> -> last name
		<LPWSTR propid="0x4024"> -> middle nameA
		....
	 to have an XML file specific of the database.
	3) then import the data to standard applications : addressbooks, mails, etc...

BUGS :

 - should have more options to chose the database by name, oid, etc...
 - should be able to choose the filename
 - why not dump the result to the screen ?
 - validate against a DTD
