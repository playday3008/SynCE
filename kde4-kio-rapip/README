SynCE kio-rapip
===============

RAPIP is the short form for "RAPI-Protocol". It is a full featured KIOSlave 
used to browse through the PDA file system via the SynCE infrastructure, and to
copy files to and from the PDA by drag and drop via Konqueror.

To use, simply open Konqueror, Dolphin, or any other KIO-enabled file manager
and type in synce://DEVICENAME/ to the address bar. If you are not sure about
the name of your device, simply go to synce:/ which will show the first device
it finds.

The protocol name rapip: has been deprecated in favour of synce:, please use
synce: .
