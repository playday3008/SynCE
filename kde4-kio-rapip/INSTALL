Compiling and Installing
Requisites
    * Install the base SynCE libraries (synce-core) as described at
      http://www.synce.org/. If you installed binary packages provided by your
      distribution, ensure you install the -devel packages as well.
    * Make the SynCE libraries work by getting connected for the first time.
      This would involve either *dccm or synce-hal. Test by running
	  # pstatus
      which should return information about your device when it is connected.
    * Install the KDE4 development files and all its dependencies, usually
      provided by your distribution. The package is often named kdelibs4-devel or
      libkde4-devel. To perform the actual configuration of the sources install cmake.

SynCE kde4-kio-rapip compilation and installation

NOTE: This package uses CMAKE, not autotools to configure and build the sources!

   1. Download the source tarball or check out the latest code from the SVN
      repository.

   2. If you are using the source tarball, unpack the downloaded file into your 
      favorite source directory
          # tar -xzvf kde4-kio-rapip-VERSION.tar.gz

   3. If you checked out a copy from subversion, create a build directory.
	  # mkdir ./build

   4. Configure your source tree with cmake.
	  # cd ./build
	  # cmake ..
      Your installation of KDE may not look within the /usr/local directory for
      services. In that case instead run
	  # cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
      which will install directly to the /usr directory instead.

   5. After configuring, compile and install it by simply doing from within the
      build directory a
          # make
      and as root (or using sudo)
          # make install

   6. To uninstall simply issue from within the build directory as root
	  # make uninstall
      or alternatively use the list of installed files from install_manifest.txt.
