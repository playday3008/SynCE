Some major TODO:

* Implement connection with liborange, such that any installer can be 
  installed through the program.

* Display more info about the phone when connected. Should be quite easy
  to implement this.

* Make the PhoneCommunicator class more of a proxy object, that will fetch
  and cache some of the data. Furthermore, it should check every (say 15) 
  seconds and look for changes in any status

* Start making use of threading

* While copying file, make use of a callback function that will allow the
  user to see the progress of the file copy
