	* Major rewrite into two separate components, one GUI component and one
	  dataserver component. These both run in their own separate proces,
	  meaning we don't have any problems with the threading within python
	  anymore.
	* Added support for listening to Status events generated when ActiveSync
	  process is going on. Currently it only shows an animated icon when
	  sync to sync-engine is in progress (NB does not have to be sync with
	  opensync!)
	* Added support for only starting the application once
	* Added support for starting the application in system-tray
	* Added support for starting the dataserver only (useful for later with
   	  d-busactivation)

	  GUI thread.

	* SynCE-KDM project renamed to SynCE-KPM. The problem is
	  that the KDM part could easily be confused with the 
	  KDE Desktop Manager. The name is now
	  SynCE KDE PDA Manager  (SynCE-KPM)
	* Changes in directory structure to make packaging easier later on

2007-12-20	Guido Diepen	<guido@jcwodan.nl>

	  used to find out if odccm is running and when devices
	  are connected/disconnected
	* Included CeDevice class, copied from synce-gnome application
	* Made the PhoneCommunicator class Observable. Other classes
	  can add a listener with a callback that will be called as
	  soon as the state of the phone changes.
