	* SynCE-KDM project renamed to SynCE-KPM. The problem is
	  that the KDM part could easily be confused with the 
	  KDE Desktop Manager. The name is now
	  SynCE KDE PDA Manager  (SynCE-KPM)
	* Changes in directory structure to make packaging easier later on

	* SynCE-KDM now makes use of DBus to get information about 
	  connected phone. Furthermore the DBus information is also
	  used to find out if odccm is running and when devices
	  are connected/disconnected
	* Included CeDevice class, copied from synce-gnome application
	* Made the PhoneCommunicator class Observable. Other classes
	  can add a listener with a callback that will be called as
	  soon as the state of the phone changes.
