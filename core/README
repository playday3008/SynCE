The purpose of the SynCE project is to provide a means of communication with
a Windows Mobile, or Windows CE, device from a computer running Linux,
FreeBSD or a similar operating system.

Libsynce is the core library for the SynCE project tools, containing various
utility and helper functions, and an implementation of RAPI. It is required
for all the major components of the project.

The RAPI code is an open source implementation that works like RAPI.DLL,
available on Microsoft operating systems. The library makes it possible to make
remote calls to a computer running device. Documentation for the RAPI calls
is available at this address:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wcesdkr/htm/_wcesdk_CeRapiInit.asp

In order to use rapi calls, a daemon that the device client connects to must be
running on the computer using rapi.
