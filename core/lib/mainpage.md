SynCE           {#mainpage}
=====

The SynCE project is used to connect and synchronise Windows CE
and Mobile devices, synonymous with Microsoft Activesync.

The core package includes a dccm daemon to initiate and maintain
communication, a library for application access, and a set
of command line tools to manipulate the device and it's data.

For details of how the connection is established see @ref architecture
