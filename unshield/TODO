TODO for Unshield
=================

- Make independent of libsynce (cut & paste?)

- Read file format in a different way, quoting Stuart Caie (author of cabextract):

Secondly, you are probably already aware of my style and opinions on reading 
structures from disk after seeing cabextract, but I'll repeat it anyway 
for the sake of advocating this style :)  I don't overlay raw byte-streams 
with structures or types. I read disk data as  arrays of bytes, then extract 
data elements from those arrays of bytes in an endian neutral manner. My 
only architectural concern is that fread() works like CHAR_BIT == 8 and I 
don't need to concern myself about changing type sizes, lack of exact 
8/16/32 bit types, structure packing rules, compiler extensions, etc. It 
also means I can pick and choose the data elements I store, in the order I 
want them and it also allows faster access to structure members once I've 
taken the hit of reading the data in. The end result is very widely 
compatible with the C compilers of this world, and of equal speed on non-x86 
architectures (at the penalty of slowing x86 :)
