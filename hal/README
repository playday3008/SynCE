synce-hal
---------

Synce-hal is a connection framework and dccm-implementation 
for Windows Mobile devices that integrates with HAL.

Please visit the SynCE website for more information:

  http://www.synce.org/

To use this package, you will require at least version 0.11
of the core synce libraries and tools.

For usb connections, most devices should be autodetected, if
yours is not please inform the synce project and we'll fix it !

FreeBSD
-------
The majority of development has been with Linux, however
FreeBSD does seem to work. The detection rules are not as
refined however.

Bluetooth
---------
Wireless interfaces are a little trickier over hal. There
are some ideas in the bluetooth directory, which have shown
some success.
