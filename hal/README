synce-hal
---------

Synce-hal is a connection framework and dccm-implementation 
for Windows Mobile devices that integrates with HAL.

Please visit the SynCE website for more information:

  http://www.synce.org/

To use this package, you will require at least version 0.11
of the core synce libraries and tools.

For usb connections, most devices should be autodetected, if
yours is not please inform the synce project and we'll fix it !
Both WM5/6 and older style devices are fully supported. If you
want to connect WM5/6 over rndis (advanced network functionality)
then you will need to install the usb-rndis-lite modules, until
such time as the changes required are accepted into the main
kernel tree. Rndis connections will attempt to use dhcp, only
falling back to a static configuration if that is unsuccessful.

FreeBSD
-------
The majority of development has been with Linux, however
FreeBSD does seem to work. The detection rules are not as
refined however.

Bluetooth
---------
Wireless interfaces are a little trickier over hal. There
are some ideas in the bluetooth directory, which have shown
some success.

Bug reports
-----------
If you find you have problems, before reporting them can you
please increase the debugging output level to the logs. This can
be done at the top of the hal scripts hal-synce-serial and
hal-synce-rndis, depending on the connection method you are using.
