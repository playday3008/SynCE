SynCE-mcvf 0.1.1 by Michael Lashkevich, 10.06.2003


       Midnight Commander virtual filesystem for SynCE


INTRODUCTION

The package "synce-mcvf" makes it possible to open the Windows CE
filesystem of your Pocket PC as a Midnight Commander virtual filesystem,
once you connected to your Pocket PC using SynCE.

After installing this package you can use "cd #synce" or "cd #synceroot"
to enter the filesystem of the Windows CE.

cd #synce

works faster and changes directory to "\My Documents".

cd #synceroot

starts much slower and enters the root directory ("\") of Windows CE.
The last is intended for administrative use only.


INSTALLATION

Please, install SynCE package <http://synce.sourseforge.net/synce/> to
make connection to your Pocket PC.

Then follow the instructions:

1. Enter your UNIX system as a root.

2. Unpack the archive:

tar zxvf synce-mcfs.tar.gz

2. Change directory

cd <prefix>/mc/extfs

where <prefix> is tipically "/usr/share",  "/usr/lib",
"/usr/local/share", or "/usr/local/lib".

3. Copy the contents of the archive into this directory, e.g.:

cp /root/synce-mcfs/src/* .

4. Add the file "extfs.ini.add" to "extfs.ini" at the end:

cat extfs.ini.add >> extfs.ini

Installation is completed.
