Overview
--------

Librapi is part of the SynCE project:
  
  http://synce.sourceforge.net/

The RAPI library is an open source implementation that works like RAPI.DLL,
available on Microsoft operating systems. The library makes it possible to make
remote calls to a computer running Pocket PC.

In order to use librapi, a daemon that the Pocket PC client connects to must be
running on the computer using librapi.

See README.contributing for information about contributing to this project.

See README.design for information about the design of librapi2.

If your question has not been covered before, send it to the synce-devel
mailing list.


External requirements
---------------------

libiconv (which is usally already present on your system :-)

Check, a unit test framework for C, version 8.3.1 later!

Installation from CVS
---------------------

o Make sure you have these versions of the GNU autotools:

    autoconf-2.53
    automake-1.6.1
    libtool-1.4.2

o Checkout "librapi2" as described on:

    http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=30550

o Generate scripts and things:

    ./bootstrap

o Configure:

    ./configure
 
  Use the --help parameter to view configuration options.

o Build:

    make

o Install:

    make install


MacOS X installation
--------------------

You probably have libiconv in /sw so you use --with-libiconv-prefix=/sw as
parameter to the configure script.

If you get error messages about duplicate symbols, you can try to call the
configure script with the --disable-shared parameter.


Solaris installation
--------------------

The libiconv provided by Sun sucks. Get GNU libiconv and install it for example
in /usr/local and use --with-libiconv-prefix=/usr/local as parameter to the
configure script.
