Librapi is part of the SynCE project:
  
  http://www.synce.org/

The RAPI library is an open source implementation that works like RAPI.DLL,
available on Microsoft operating systems. The library makes it possible to make
remote calls to a computer running device. Documentation for the RAPI calls
is available at this address:

  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/wcesdkr/htm/_wcesdk_CeRapiInit.asp

In order to use librapi, a daemon that the device client connects to must be
running on the computer using librapi.
