TODO for librapi2
=================

o Implement more of RAPI

o Make config use synce_log and not perror.

o Make the file system tools use "My Documents" as current directory.

o Add tool "pcat"

o Make SORTORDERSPEC stuff work in CeCreateDatabase()

o Improve synce-install-cab script: 

  I had to make a slight modification as the SmartPhone[0] expects
  new CABs to exist in /IPSM/Windows/AppMgr rather than just
  /Windows/AppMgr but once this change is made to the script it
  works fine to install stuff.

o Make the RAPI commands timeout of the connection is lost to the device

o In rapi 1 CeReadRecordProps() and CeWriteRecordProps(), figure out how
  to deal with CEVT_R8, and make use of rgPropID in CeReadRecordProps()
