	* src/rapi_indirection.c - enable CeSetEndOfFile()

2008-08-19  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* python/pyrapi2.pyx - don't segfault on empty strings

2008-08-11  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* tools/pls.c - option for recursive listing
	* tools/man/pls.1 - man page update for recursive listing

2008-06-17  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* recursive directory copy for pcp

	* more useful error messages for pls and pcp

2008-05-19  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* rewrite rapi 1 CeReadRecordProps() and CeWriteRecordProps() to
	  account for non-32 bit host pointers

2008-05-11  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* remaining dummy functions for unimplemented calls

2008-05-09  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* introduced dummy functions for most calls represented in the
	  header but not implemented, returns failure with rapi error
	  set to E_NOTIMPL instead of segfaulting
	* in rapi 1, pass result_2 into rapi error, this is an HRESULT

2008-05-09  Jonny Lamb  <jonnylamb@jonnylamb.com>

	* script/synce-remove-program.1: Escaped minus signs so they're not
	hyphens. Notified by lintian.

	* fixed compiler warnings

2008-04-13  Jonny Lamb  <jonnylamb@jonnylamb.com>

	* Removed spec file.

2008-04-11  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* modified rapi_context_connect() to deal with version 5.0
	  that is actually WM2003

2008-04-01  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* dummy function for rapi1 CeGetDiskFreeSpaceEx, prevents segfault
	  when this is called

2008-03-26  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* correct build without python bindings (bug 1708885)

2008-03-25  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* fixed input buffer length in tools/rapiconfig.c
	* fixed rapi1 CeProcessConfig (after a fashion)

2008-03-23  Guido Diepen  <guido@guidodiepen.nl>

	* Rewrote the thread-safe code to make use of pthread_once. Instead of
	using my own mutexes to ensure a key for the TSL was only created once, I
	now use pthread_once to ensure that the create_key method is called only
	once. Thanks David for pointing this out.

2008-03-23  Guido Diepen  <guido@guidodiepen.nl>

	* Renabled the thread-safe code. Segfaults in sync-engine were
	  caused by the fact that sync-engine tried to access rapi_context of 
	  one thread via another thread. Resolved in sync-engine

      became less stable with this. 
2008-03-23  Guido Diepen  <guido@guidodiepen.nl>

	* Put the thread-safety code in ifdef. Turned out that sync-engine
      became less stable with this. 
      Currently thread-safe code has been deactivated till further notice.

2008-03-20  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* BSD compatible fixes suggested by Bakulin Ilya, many thanks

2008-03-15  Guido Diepen  <guido@guidodiepen.nl>

	* Made librapi2 thread-safe by removing the static RapiContext. This is
	  replaced by pthreads thread local storage. 

2008-01-11  Guido Diepen  <guido@guidodiepen.nl>

	* Added a non-blocking CeWriteFile (it will release GIL before starting)
	* Added a non-blocking CeProcessConfig ( not used yet though )

2008-01-11  Guido Diepen  <guido@guidodiepen.nl>

	* Increased the timeout used for reading data from the socket. Old value
	  of 15 was causing too many timeouts. New value is set to 120 seconds.

2008-01-09  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* added LICENSE to EXTRA_DIST
	* added hal support to rapi_context

2008-01-07  Guido Diepen  <guido@guidodiepen.nl>

	* Fixed small bug in raising error in closeHandle function
	* Added python binding for CeGetSystemInfo
	* Added python binding for CeGetVersionEx

2007-12-27  Guido Diepen  <guido@jcwodan.nl>

	* Small fix in rapi2 call of CeCreateProcess2 (remove optional-read)
	* Added python binding for CeFindAllFiles
	* Added python binding for CeCloseHandle
	* Added python binding for CeCreateFile
	* Added python binding for CeReadFile
	* Added python binding for CeWriteFilea
	* Added python binding for CeCreateProcess
	* Note, all of the above are initial implementations, more studying
	  has to be done regarding error handling. Problem is inconsistency
	  with error handling in the original microsoft code, sometimes 
	  zero means succes, sometimes non-zero means succes
	
2007-12-23  Guido Diepen  <guido@jcwodan.nl>

	* Added python binding for CeGetDiskFreeSpaceEx()
	
2007-12-23  Guido Diepen  <guido@jcwodan.nl>

	* added RAPI2 implementation of CeGetDiskFreeSpaceEx()
	  rapi call.
	* Some minor fixes in types (also were fixed in libsynce)
	* Updated README in rapi2 to show which methods are 
	  implemented and which not.
	
2007-12-18  Guido Diepen  <guido@jcwodan.nl>

	* added python binding for CeGetSystemPowerStatus
	
2007-12-17  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* more registry fixes in rapi1
	* added CeRegDeleteKey() and CeRegDeleteValue() to rapi 1
