	* Put the thread-safety code in ifdef. Turned out that sync-engine
      became less stable with this. 
      Currently thread-safe code has been deactivated till further notice.

	* BSD compatible fixes suggested by Bakulin Ilya, many thanks

2008-03-15  Guido Diepen  <guido@guidodiepen.nl>

	* Made librapi2 thread-safe by removing the static RapiContext. This is
	  replaced by pthreads thread local storage. 

2008-01-11  Guido Diepen  <guido@guidodiepen.nl>

	* Added a non-blocking CeWriteFile (it will release GIL before starting)
	* Added a non-blocking CeProcessConfig ( not used yet though )

2008-01-11  Guido Diepen  <guido@guidodiepen.nl>

	* Increased the timeout used for reading data from the socket. Old value
	  of 15 was causing too many timeouts. New value is set to 120 seconds.

2008-01-09  Mark Ellis  <mark@mpellis.org.uk>

	* added LICENSE to EXTRA_DIST
	* added hal support to rapi_context

2007-12-27  Guido Diepen  <guido@jcwodan.nl>

	* Small fix in rapi2 call of CeCreateProcess2 (remove optional-read)
	* Added python binding for CeFindAllFiles
	* Added python binding for CeCloseHandle
	* Added python binding for CeCreateFile
	* Added python binding for CeReadFile
	* Added python binding for CeWriteFilea
	* Added python binding for CeCreateProcess
	* Note, all of the above are initial implementations, more studying
	  has to be done regarding error handling. Problem is inconsistency
	  with error handling in the original microsoft code, sometimes 
	  zero means succes, sometimes non-zero means succes
