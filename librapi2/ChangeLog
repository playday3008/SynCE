2007-12-27  Guido Diepen  <guido@jcwodan.nl>

	* Small fix in rapi2 call of CeCreateProcess2 (remove optional-read)
	* Added python binding for CeFindAllFiles
	* Added python binding for CeCloseHandle
	* Added python binding for CeCreateFile
	* Added python binding for CeReadFile
	* Added python binding for CeWriteFilea
	* Added python binding for CeCreateProcess
	* Note, all of the above are initial implementations, more studying
	  has to be done regarding error handling. Problem is inconsistency
	  with error handling in the original microsoft code, sometimes 
	  zero means succes, sometimes non-zero means succes
