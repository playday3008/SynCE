Introduction:
-------------

	- Python add-ons for
	  - Richard Taylor's (r.taylor@bcs.org.uk) Python-wrapper-classes "pyrapi" around
	    - "librapi2" a part of
	      - David Eriksson's "SynCE"-project (http://synce.sourceforge.net/)

	Rem: Above indentation is intentionally.


Contents:
---------

Ls.py
	Based on Richard Taylor's "pyrapi":
	A little terminal "ls"-command for the PDA.


CE_DirView.py
	Based on the QT-Example "dirview".
	I wrote this, because I wanted a GUI but unfortunately I've only
	KDE-2 installed and don't want to upgrade to KDE-3 right now.
	Perhaps this is an alternative for other people also, who don't
	want or can use SynCE-KDE.

	Imports:  "PreferencesDialog.py"


CE_DirViewServer.py
	Allow to forward file-system-info from a PocketPC to a remote client.
	Only the server needs "SynCE" and "pyrapi" installed - and of course
	the PDA connected.
	The client needs only Python - and of course a connetion to the server ;-)
	See "pydoc CE_DirViewServer".
	You need also "synce-python-adds_fake_YY-MM-DD" installed (this is packaged
	with pyrapi as contrib/qt_fake).


DebugPrint.py
	Utilities for debug printing.



Depends:
--------

pyrapi-0_4, synce-0.8.4, (PyQt)


License:
--------

In keeping with the license of pyrapi...

MIT License, see the file LICENSE for details.


Instructions:
-------------

	A. If you have SynCE and pyrapi installed (direct connection):

	   $ CE_DirView.py
	

	B. If you don't have SynCE installed. You must have "synce-python-adds_fake_YY-MM-DD"
	   installed on the client.
	   You need a server with SynCE and pyrapi (real-, not fake-version!) installed.

	   1. On the Server:

	      $ CE_DirViewServer.py -h host

	   2. On the client:

	      a. Define the server. This has to be done only once!

	         $ python pyrapi/pyrapi.py -h host [-p port]

	         Where host is the name or IP of the computer defined at "1.".

	      b. Start the client. E.g.:

	         $ CE_DirView.py

	Use "pydoc CE_DirView" or "pydoc CE_DirViewServer.py" to get more info.
