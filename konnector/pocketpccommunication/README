Test Application For Windows CE 3.0 devices

This readme should help you to find the necessary libraries, install this
software and tell you how to use it. If something is missing feel free to
write me a mail under cfremgen@users.sourceforge.net.

1. Needed external libraries and applications

Installation hint:
For synCE-KDE, kitchensync and this software please use the following:
./configure --prefix=/path/to/kde3


1.1 synCE libraries

The synCE libraries are absolutely necessary to enable communication with
the external device. You can find them here: http://synce.sourceforge.net.
Please notice that this piece of software is developed with the synce-0.9.0 
libraries!
Please check the functionality of these libraries with your device. 
The tests within these libraries should work!


1.2 synCE-KDE 

As this is software in developement please use the vdccm utility instead
of dccm. SynCE-KDE can be found here: http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/kde/


1.3 KDE and KDE-PIM

You do need an installed KDE 3.3.x plus the new KDE-PIM 3.3.0.


1.4 kitchensync

As the kitchensync within KDE-PIM 3.3.0 is not very useful please download
and install the 0.0.8-distribution from here: 
http://handhelds.org/~zecke/kitchensync.html




2. Basic functionality of this software

This package is a testing software. It has been developed to learn about
the synCE-libraries. Nevertheless it has some handy functions.
Maybe the most important one is the possiblity to backup and restore data
from/to the device. The data is stored in ~/.kde/share/apps/pocketpccommunication.
Every dataset has the name of the partnership in the file name. So using
multiple devices should be no problem (but as I only have one device this has
not been testet!) 

PLEASE NOTE:
As this is testing software it is possible that the connection to the device
breaks! If this happens please restart the connection to the device and the
application. I also encountered this with the rra-get-types utility in
conjunction with a Futjitsu Siemens LOOX with USB connection. 


2.1 Get Types

This returns all the types which are available on this device. The returned
listview is clickable to get the ids and state of all the entries which are
stored within this type. 


2.2 Getting and Pushing Data

You can separately get and push Addressbook- and Calendar-data. Additionally
it is possible to deal with events and todos. The data is stored in the
files which can be specified within the preferences.


2.3 Syncing Data

As you will see the menu entries for syncing data are disabled: 
These were just tests with a rather old kitchensync version. Just ignore them.
Also the konnector is disabled, because testing within kitchensync is 
much better implemented than here.


2.4 Backup and Restore

Maybe the most useful functions in the application. You can make a full backup
of your data to files in ~/.kde/share/apps/pocketpccommunication. The files have
unique names. So although it is not tested multiple devices should work. 

DELETE EVERYTHING does what the name tells you. The complete AddressBook and
Calendar will be cleared. Please use with care.


2.5 Preferences

Please let me know if some of these entries are not clear. 
Currently only the first register seems to be useful :)

ATTENTION: Think twice before using the standard Addressbook!!
If you use it do not forget to make a backup first!! It is called std.vcf.
On my system it can be found here: ~/.kde/share/apps/kabc/std.vcf
