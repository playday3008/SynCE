synce-gnomevfs
==============

This is a gnome-vfs module that enables access to the Windows CE or Pocket
PC file system through the gnome-vfs functions.


Installation
============

Install by running ./configure and  make, then make install as root. If
libsynce or librapi isn't installed in /usr then run ./configure with
--with-libsynce=/path/to/libsynce or --with-librapi2=/path/to/librapi.

You may also need to use the --sysconfdir=/etc parameter to configure.

!!! Important !!!
Gnome can be very particular about where components are installed. To be
sure this module will work it should be installed in the same prefix as
the rest of gnome and gnomevfs. If your gnome installation is part of the
distribution, this will almost certainly be /usr.

Then you should be able to access your PPC using synce:/ for example in
Nautilus.

If you want a "Mobile Device" entry in your "Computer" folder in Nautilus
when your device is connected, run this command as the user (not root)
after installation:

  synce-in-computer-folder install
