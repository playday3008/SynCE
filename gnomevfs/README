This is a gnome-vfs module that enables access to the Windows CE or Pocket
PC file system through the gnome-vfs functions.

Install by running ./configure and  make, then make install as root. If
libsynce or librapi isn't installed in /usr then run ./configure with
--with-libsynce=/path/to/libsynce or --with-librapi2=/path/to/librapi.

You may also need to use the --sysconfdir=/etc parameter to configure.

Then you should be able to access your PPC using synce:/ for example in
Nautilus.

If you want a "Mobile Device" entry in your "Computer" folder in Nautilus
when your device is connected, run this command as the user (not root)
after installation:

  synce-in-computer-folder install
