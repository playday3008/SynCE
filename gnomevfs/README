This is a gnome-vfs module that enables access to the PPC file system
through the gnome-vfs functions.

Install by running ./configure and  make, then make install as root. If
libsynce or librapi isn't installed in /usr then run ./configure with
--with-libsynce=/path/to/libsynce or --with-librap=/path/to/librapi

Then you should be able to access your PPC using synce:/ for example in
Nautilus. Do not try to access your device when it's not connected, then
you will not be able to access it later once it's connected until you
restart Nautilus.
