For 2.6 kernels only!

This driver has been known to solve USB connection problems on the following
Linux distributions:

- Suse 9.1
- Debian Unstable
- Gentoo

It is also known to work on the following Linux distributions:

- Fedora Core 2


1.  Install the kernel source code

    On Suse, you do like this:

      yast -i kernel-source

2.  Only on Suse! Install the "kernel-syms" package:

      yast -i kernel-syms

    Make sure that all kernel-* packages have the same version:

      # rpm -q kernel-default kernel-source kernel-syms
      kernel-default-2.6.5-7.95
      kernel-source-2.6.5-7.95
      kernel-syms-2.6.5-7.95

3.  Build the "ipaq" kernel driver module:

      make

    If you get the message like this then point 2 above failed for some reason:

    WARNING: Symbol version dump
    /usr/src/linux-2.6.5-7.95-obj/i386/default/Module.symvers is missing, modules
    will have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS disabled.

4.  Try the driver

    First remove a previous "ipaq" kernel module from memory if it is already
    loaded:

      rmmod ipaq

    If you get the message "ERROR: Module ipaq does not exist in /proc/modules",
    ignore it! (The message just means that the module was not loaded.)

    Now load the module:

      modprobe usbserial
      insmod ./ipaq.ko

5.  Connect your device according to the instructions on this page:

      http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/start.php

6.  If everything works properly you can install the module:

      make install
