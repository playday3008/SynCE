For 2.6 kernels only!

1.  Install the kernel source code. This varies between different Linux
    distributions. Please consult the manuals for your distribution if you don't
    know how to do this.


2.  Only on Suse! Install the "kernel-syms" package:

      yast -i kernel-syms

    Make sure that all kernel-* packages have the same version:

      # rpm -q kernel-default kernel-source kernel-syms
      kernel-default-2.6.5-7.95
      kernel-source-2.6.5-7.95
      kernel-syms-2.6.5-7.95


3.  Open the Makefile with a text editor and customize it according to the 
    comments in the top of the file.


4.  Build the "ipaq" kernel driver module:

      make

    If you get a message like this then point 2 above failed for some reason:

      "WARNING: Symbol version dump
       /usr/src/linux-2.6.5-7.95-obj/i386/default/Module.symvers is missing, 
       modules will have CONFIG_MODVERSIONS disabled."

    If you get a message like this, provide the correct path to the Linux
    kernel source code according to point 3 above:
    
      "Can't find directory /usr/src/linux-2.6.10-5-686/drivers/usb/serial"


5.  Try the driver

    First remove a previous "ipaq" kernel module from memory if it is already
    loaded:

      rmmod ipaq

    If you get the message "ERROR: Module ipaq does not exist in /proc/modules",
    just ignore it! (The message just means that the module was not loaded.)

    Now load the module:

      modprobe usbserial
      insmod ./ipaq.ko
      

6.  Connect your device according to the instructions on this page:

      http://synce.sourceforge.net/synce/howto.php

      
7.  If everything works properly you can install the module:

      make install
