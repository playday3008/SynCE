If your question has not been covered before, send it to the synce-devel
mailing list.


External requirements
---------------------

libiconv (which is usally already present on your system :-)

Check, a unit test framework for C, version 8.3.1 later!

  http://check.sourceforge.net/


Installation from CVS
---------------------

o Make sure you have these versions of the GNU autotools:

    autoconf-2.53
    automake-1.6.1
    libtool-1.4.2

o Checkout "libsynce" as described on:

    http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=30550

o Generate scripts and things:

    ./bootstrap

o Configure:

    ./configure
 
  Use the --help parameter to view configuration options.

o Build:

    make

o Install:

    make install


MacOS X installation
--------------------

You probably have libiconv in /sw so you use --with-libiconv-prefix=/sw as
parameter to the configure script.

If you get error messages about duplicate symbols, you can try to call the
configure script with the --disable-shared parameter.


Solaris installation
--------------------

The libiconv provided by Sun sucks. Get GNU libiconv and install it in, for
example, /usr/local and use --with-libiconv-prefix=/usr/local as parameter to
the configure script.
