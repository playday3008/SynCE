    <title>History</title>

    <para>The SynCE project was started by Ludovic Lange. The
      sourceforge project pages were established at this time and the
      first version of the RAPI library appeared in the CVS. David
      Eriksson joined the project in July 2001 and became a project
      manager in October. In the following few months the basic
      functions of the library (initialization and file handling) took
      shape and a few simple tools appeared.
    </para> 
    <para>Ganesh started to contribute the usb code about March 2002.
    </para>
    <para>Progress was fairly slow until David Eriksson reorganized
      the library code into separate libraries with cleaner interfaces
      in July 2002. This was followed by new modules for connecting to
      the PDA (synce-serial) and a replacement for the ayncd program
      (dccm). In October 2002 the database write functions were made
      to work and September 2002 the registry functions made their
      first appearance. 
    </para>
    <para>In November 2002 David released the first packaged
      distribution of the SynCE code and established the user mailing
      list. In December 2002 Richard Taylor released the first version
      of the Python wrappers for librapi2.
    </para>
    <para>With all of the main foundations for SynCE now in place work
      has started on the activesync protocols and more developers are
      started to appear on the mailing list.
