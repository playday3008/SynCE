This is the documentation for the SynCE project.

The documentation is written in the DocBook XML format. Unfortunately
turning the DocBook files into readable formats requires a rather
complex tool chain. Currently the build process is known to work with
the following tool chain: 

	xsltproc 
	fop-0.20.4
	xsl-stylesheets-1.50.0

If you have any luck with other tool chains please let me know.
