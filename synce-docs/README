This is the documentation for the SynCE project.

The documentation is written in the DocBook XML format. Unfortunately
turning the DocBook files into readable formats requires a rather
complex tool chain. Currently the build process is known to work with
the following tool chain: 

	xsltproc 
	fop-0.20.4
	xsl-stylesheets-1.50.0 (and above)

If you have any luck with other tool chains please let me know.

To build the docs you will need (at the very least) to change the 
<group  xml:base="/home/rjt/lib/xml/" > in docbook/catalog.xml to
point to where your copy of docbook-xml-4.2 and docbook-xsl-1.58.1 are
located. If you have a direct connection to the Internet the tools
should work even if you do not have local copies of the DTD and
stylesheets, but it will be very slow because the complete DTD and
stylesheet will be downloaded every time you run make.

"make help" will show the available make targets.
