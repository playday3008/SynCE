	+ Overall changes:
		+ Fixed some compile-problems. The following compiler / kde / qt
		  versions are now supported:
		  	gcc-2.95.x, gcc-3.2.x, kde-3.0, kde-3.1, qt-3.0, qt-3.1
		  Checked combinations:
		  	gcc-2.95.x + kde-3.0 + qt-3.0
			gcc-2.95.x + kde-3.1 + qt-3.1
			gcc-3.2.x  + kde-3.1 + qt-3.1
	* Changes in rapip:
		+ The code has been completely restructured.
		+ Much more error-checking is now done. It should now react
		  rasonable on (hopefully) every error.
		+ The librapi-library now is CeRapiUninit()´ed after every
		  transaction.
	+ Changes in raki:
		+ The proprietary method for copying the dragged file up into 
		  the /Windows/AppMgr/Install-directory of the PDA has been 
		  replaced by a FileCopyJob. So it integrates cleanly into KDE. 
		  One can now drag a cab-file from a remote ftp-server and 
		  drop it on the systray-icon and the file gets installed.
		+ ProgressBar-Dialog has gone and has been replaced by the
		  progress-window of the FileCopyJob.
		+ More than one file could now be installed onto the PDA 
		  simultaniously.
		+ dccm now started by a KProcess.
		+ Startup and restart of dccm should now be reliable.
		+ The path to the dccm-executable could now be configured via
		  the config-dialog.
		+ New menu-item for opening the filesystem "rapip:/" directly.
