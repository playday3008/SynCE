	+ Update to compile with synce-07

2003-02-18  Volker Christian <voc@soft.uni-linz.ac.at>
	+ Overall changes:
		+ Like always ... code polish.
	+ Changes in rapip:
		none
	+ Changes in raki:
		+ Added "Connect" and "Disconnect" menu entries to connect to and
		  disconnect from a PDA.
		+ "Masquerading"-Feature added. To enable this feature you have to
		  do the following tasks:
		  - grant permissions to the raki-user to execute /usr/sbin/iptables 
		    as root via a sudo call. For this add a line similar to
		  	    <raki-user>     ALL = (root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/iptables
		    to the /etc/suduers file of your machine. See soduers(5) for in
		    depth details.
		  - Setting up a nameservice for the PDA.
		    Two possibilities (only do one of them):
		    1. Setting up a forwarding nameserver on your machine.
		       For this add a forwarders-section to the /etc/named.conf file       
		       	     forwarders {
                		uuu.vvv.xxx.yyy;
        		     };
		       with uuu.vvv.xxx.yyy be the ip-address of a valid nameserver.
		    2. Change the ip-address on line
		    	  ms-dns 192.168.xxx.yyy
		       in the /etc/ppp/peers/synce-device file to point to a valid
		       nameserver.
		    After doing this steps you can download your daily newspaper with
		    AvantGo, browse the www with IE ...

	+ Overall changes:
		+ Fixed some compile-problems. The following compiler / kde / qt
		  versions are now supported:
		  	gcc-2.95.x, gcc-3.2.x, kde-3.0, kde-3.1, qt-3.0, qt-3.1
		  Checked combinations:
		  	gcc-2.95.x + kde-3.0 + qt-3.0
			gcc-2.95.x + kde-3.1 + qt-3.1
			gcc-3.2.x  + kde-3.1 + qt-3.1
	* Changes in rapip:
		+ The code has been completely restructured.
		+ Much more error-checking is now done. It should now react
		  rasonable on (hopefully) every error.
		+ The librapi-library now is CeRapiUninit()´ed after every
		  transaction.
	+ Changes in raki:
		+ The proprietary method for copying the dragged file up into 
		  the /Windows/AppMgr/Install-directory of the PDA has been 
		  replaced by a FileCopyJob. So it integrates cleanly into KDE. 
		  One can now drag a cab-file from a remote ftp-server and 
		  drop it on the systray-icon and the file gets installed.
		+ ProgressBar-Dialog has gone and has been replaced by the
		  progress-window of the FileCopyJob.
		+ More than one file could now be installed onto the PDA 
		  simultaniously.
		+ dccm now started by a KProcess.
		+ Startup and restart of dccm should now be reliable.
		+ The path to the dccm-executable could now be configured via
		  the config-dialog.
		+ New menu-item for opening the filesystem "rapip:/" directly.
