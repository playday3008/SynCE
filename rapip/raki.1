.TH "raki - SYNCE-KDE" "1" 
.SH "NAME" 
raki \(em a PC / Windows CE connection service application like ActiveSync 
.SH "SYNOPSIS" 
.PP 
\fBraki\fP 
.SH "DESCRIPTION" 
.PP 
This manual page documents briefly the 
\fBraki\fP program. 
.PP 
\fBraki\fP is a synonym for  
"Remote-Access-KIcker-applet". As the name suggests it has first  
been an applet for kicker, the KDE panel but as time goes by the  
application-type changed. Today RAKI is an application docking into  
the KDE system-tray. It is responsible for all additional tasks  
which are desired for interacting with the PDA via the desktop. 
.SH "OPTIONS" 
.PP 
This program doesn't have any command line arguments. 
.SH "FEATURES" 
.PP 
* support for multiple connected PDAs; 
 
* a plugin-based synchronization architecture, including at present a  
synchronizer for PDA contacts and the standard KDE address book and  
AvantGo synchronization; 
 
* copying files / directories via drag'n'drop to / from the PDA,  
including mimetype support; 
 
* Internet connectivity for PDAs via NAT; 
 
* sounds for event notifications (connections, password requests and  
disconnections); 
 
* simple CAB file installation on PDAs; 
 
* PDA software management; 
 
* program launching on the PDA; 
 
* PDA system information and power status display; 
 
* auto-response to PDA password requests; 
 
* configuration of passwords, NAT routes and synchronization settings  
per device; 
 
* support for PDA partnerships. 
 
.SH "USAGE" 
.PP 
Launch the application from the "K\-Menu\->Utilities"\-Menu or, 
if you don't have a "K\-Menu\->Utilities\->Raki" entry, start RAKI from  
the command line by issuing "raki". You will get a new icon located  
in the system-tray. 
.PP 
Right click on that icon shows a popup menu containing infrastructure  
related items. 
.PP 
If there are connected devices left click will open a popup menu  
containing individual device menu items for every connected PDA. Drag  
and drop of CAB-files onto the RAKI system-tray icon installs them on  
a device. A dialog box lets you choose the destination PDA. Choosing  
"Synchronize" from an individual device menu starts synchronizing that  
PDA and your desktop.
