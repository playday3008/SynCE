In order to configure and build Rapip and Raki you need to do the following:

	- Check that you have KDE-3.1 and Qt-3.1 installed
        - cd to the rapip-0.3 directory
        - type "make -f Makefile.cvs"
        - type "./configure"
        - type "make"
        - type "make install" as root.
	- type "cp raki/raki.sh ~/.synce/scripts" and
	- type "chmod 755 ~/.synce/scripts/raki.sh" for every rapip/raki-user.

First start:
- Launch Raki from the "KMenu->Utilities"-Menu. You should find a new 
  black&white icon in your System-Tray.
- Right-klick on the icon lets you choose some actions to manipulate dccm and to
  configure the Raki-Applet.
- Make sure dccm is running eighter via Raki or by starting it on the console.
- Initiate a connection by running "synce-serial-start".
- The icon in your System Tray should now be colored.
- By left-klick on the icon you can now interact with your PDA.
