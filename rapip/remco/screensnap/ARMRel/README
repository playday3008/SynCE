Rename screensnap.exe.rem to screensnap.exe and upload it onto the PDA
in an arbitrary directory. Start this program on the PDA and connect
with 
	pdamirror --pdaaddress ip.address.ofthe.ipaq

You have to restart screensnap.exe after shuting down pdamirror on your
desktop.
YOu will not get any informations from screensnap.exe itself. To check
if it is running use for example the "PHM Task Manager"
(http://www.phm.lu/Products/PocketPC/) and search for an process named
screensnap.

Have fun!
