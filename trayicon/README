Gnome keyring support
---------------------

Trayicon now uses gnome-keyring by default to store connection passwords.
It is probably a good idea to unset the gconf key
/apps/synce/trayicon/password for your user if you have been using
password support.

To revert to storing passwords in gconf, pass --without-gnome-keyring
to configure.
