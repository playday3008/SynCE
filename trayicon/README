DCCM
----
The old synce-dccm, also known as dccmd, is no longer supported. Use
vdccm or odccm.

Gnome keyring support
---------------------
Trayicon now uses gnome-keyring by default to store connection passwords
on a per-device basis. It is probably a good idea to unset the gconf key
/apps/synce/trayicon/password, and /apps/synce/trayicon/enable_password,
for your user if you have been using password support.
