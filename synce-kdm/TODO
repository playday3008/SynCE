Some major TODO:
* Create proxy class, that will take care of the rapi connection
  because this should not be in the GUI classes
 
* Have some error handling, instead of just trying to access the 
  device if it is not connected, resulting in a segfault
 
* Implement uninstall program

* Implement install Cab file

* Implement connection with liborange, such that any installer can be 
  installed through the program.
