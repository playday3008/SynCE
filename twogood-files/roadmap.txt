1.      Foundation
==================

All daemons and applications are meant to run as user-land processes unless
noted otherwise. All libraries should be written i ANSI C.

1.1.    The connection manager (dccm)                            [twogood]

        The purpose of this application is to listen on port 5679 and
        maintain a list of currently connected Pocket PC devices.

        The application should support tcpwrappers.

1.2.    The RAPI library (librapi)                               [twogood]

        This library implements the RAPI interface.

1.3.    The SynCE library (libsynce)                             [twogood]

        This library contains common functionality for the connection manager,
        RAPI library and other parts of SynCE. Client applications may need to
        use it to convert data types, etc.

1.4     Connections

        TODO: Make stand-alone kernel module.

1.4.4   Bluetooth                                                [twogood]

        Need to test with latest BlueZ before documenting.
