$Id$ vim: expandtab

Microsoft docs about how this is done on Windows:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/wceconct/htm/_wcesdk_handling_a_connection_notification.asp


SynCE should provide the following interfaces:


1.    Command line based (similar to "Registry-based Notification")

      Maybe this could work like the ".d" directories found in /etc/ ?

1.1.  Commands to run on connect

1.2.  Commands to run on disconnect


2.    Callback based (similar to "COM Interface-based Notification")

      This interface should be provided by libsynce.

      It will be similar to IDccMan/IDccManSink.
